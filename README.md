📌 Personal Finance Management (PFM) System

This project is a design-thinking driven Personal Finance Management (PFM) platform built to help users understand, control, and improve their financial behavior.

Unlike traditional expense trackers, this system focuses on real-time financial state updates, automatic savings adjustments, and explainable insights, ensuring that every financial decision is clear, practical, and trustworthy.

🎯 Problem Statement

Most users:

Track expenses but don’t change spending behavior

Struggle to balance saving vs investing

Lack clarity on how financial decisions affect long-term goals

This project solves that by treating finance as a dynamic system, not static reports.

💡 Solution Overview

The PFM system:

Tracks expenses in real time

Dynamically recalculates budgets and savings whenever user inputs change

Automatically channels unused budget into savings

Generates explainable financial insights

Determines investment readiness instead of giving blind investment advice

All components stay synchronized using a single source of truth for the user’s financial state.
